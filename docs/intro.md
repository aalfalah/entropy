My name is Abdelkrim. I live in SE London, UK. I'm a happy husband and father.

Fortunate enough to have experienced a variety of cultures and contexts, I strongly believe that **innovation's magic** operates at a crossroads between various disciplines. It materializes when we assimilate patterns and frameworks from one context and implement them unexpectedly in other areas.
